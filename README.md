# SortieAI
Python based GUI application for sorting and assessing image focus using Yolo11 object detection and PyWavelets wave transform.

**Features Implemented**
- Human and animal subject detection
- Waveform Image focus detection
- Bulk Image processing
- Post sort summary with Graph and Preview
- Ability to upload your own YOLO V11 models (.pt) to detect custom subjects (You will need to update the scoring algorithm)

**Instructions**
- i Select Photos you wish to sort
- ii Press Start
- iii Wait
- iii Photos are automatically moved (or copied) to the specified folder

**Set up Tips**
-_the exe, default.png and default.pt should be in root folder_
- Preferably should have its own directory since the program will create a .log and .ini file   

(Additional settings can be found in the Options tab)
(Needs Default.pt in root folder as base model unless alternative specified in options)
_Shipped with Default model version 3 but will probably updated later on._

*Default.png in root folder is not required but the program will return Path not found on start-up*
